			<h2>November Stellaris game</h2>
			<p> Our second Sellaris game will take place in the first weekend of November. both the 7th and 8th if possible <br>
				it will be a vanilla game, mainly to avoid to many desync errors like last time, but also to try out the new dlc. <br>
				the lobby will be up between 11 and 11:30 and the game will start at 12 and go on for 4-6 hours, preferably more depending, but it will on the consensus of the players. <br>
			</p>

			<p> The following origins are banned</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Shattered ring</li>
			<li>Common ground</li>
			<li>Hegemon</li>
			<li>Lost colony</li>
			<li>Scion*</li>
			</ol>

			<p> The following civics are per default banned </p>
			<ol>
			<li>Fanatic purifiers*</li>
			<li>Determined exterminator*</li>
			<li>Devouring swarm*</li>
			<li>Terravore*</li>
			</ol>

			 <h3>Guidelines for PVP</h3>
			 <p>If a players overall relative power (RP for short) is below your own (inferior or pathetic), your wargoal against that player should not be conquest (taking their planets and systems), it should instead be something like Subjugation/Hegemon.<br>
			 	Do not integrate another player if they are your vassal, a federation should not consist of more than 3-4 players unless its a hegemon. <br>
			 </p>

			 <h3>Misc. info.</h3>
			 <p>We are primarily going to use the justsomefolk discord for communication, but it is not required to be on VC, id even recommend using the ingame chat for the most part and using VC for federation or negotiations. <br>
			 	Futhermore anything marked with an * is possible to get if you talk with the host of the game which is Chopart. <br>

		<h2>Choparty's Stellaris game event (done) </h2>
		<p> It is finally time for some Stellaris </p>
		<p>
		The dates for the game are the 24 and 25 Okt. <br>
		the idea is that we play for 4 to 5 hours both days of the weekend to ensure that we might get through a whole game and so that we don't burn out by going 8 to 10 hours one day and be completely exhausted the next. <br>
		The games will run from 12 to 16 or 17, will start hosting 30 minutes before, so that people have time to join up and create their empires, the game will be password protected, the password will be posted on the Discord an hour before the game <br>
		the main theme of the game is more focused on diplomacy and roleplay rather then the minmaxed optimal strat, but there are still some origins and civics that are banned. <br>
		I hope to get enough people together such that we can play a game without any AI empires. <br>

		<p> Guidelines for PVP     - if a players overall relative power (RP for short) is below your own (inferior or pathetic), your wargoal against that player should not be conquest (taking their planets and systems), it should instead be something like Subjugation/Hegemon </p>

		<p> As some might have noticed by now, some of these origins are not vanilla and that is right, we will be using small modpackage that can be found by following this link: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2234085175  </p>
		<p> Lastly we will be using the JustSomeFolk Discord server during the game, it should be possible to find a link to that on the website </p>
