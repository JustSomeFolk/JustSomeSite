		<h1> Welcome to JSF reviews</h1>

		<p> As a community we also review games.<br>
			Reviews are written after someone from our community have tried the game, be it first impressions or from days of playtime. <br>
			If you disagree with a review we plan to have comments on them, but for now you can contact us through mail.<br>
			Most of our reviews are on steam right now, and you can see them there.

		<p> This site is under development, and will be done at some point... </p>
