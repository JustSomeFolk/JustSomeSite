		<h1> About JustSomeFolk</h1>

		<p> JSF Started back in 2015 when Kijin and Couch met through studies, they made a Discord server and started bringing in friends to play games with.
		<br>It quickly expanded and we started making our own servers for games.
		Kijin found out that there were people on Reddit that needed company in games, and he decided to invite them.<br>
		from then on we started to try to expand our group, to bring friendliness and company to lonely gamers, artists or people that just need someone to talk to.
		<br>
		<br>Our goal is to make a big friendly community, where everyone is welcome, and nobody is left out.
